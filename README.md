# AWS-hosted Virtual Classroom and Learning Platform

## Project Overview

This project is a **cloud-native virtual classroom** web application built using the Flask framework and hosted on AWS. It demonstrates the integration of core AWS services (EC2, S3, and RDS) to provide a secure, scalable, and responsive platform for digital learning.

Students can register, log in, and access course materials, while administrators can upload and manage content. The project emphasizes modern cloud deployment practices and full-stack development.
